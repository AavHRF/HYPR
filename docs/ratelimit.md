The ratelimiter is designed as a leaky bucket.
It does stuff. I'm not bothering to write serious docs
for it because honestly... ugh.

tl;dr it's a leaky bucket limiter, implemented
via decorator. source is in [limiter.py](../api/limiter.py)

actual docs will come at some point though those feel important.
