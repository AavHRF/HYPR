# HYPR
High performance API recruitment software for NationStates written in Python

# Why HYPR?
HYPR was designed to be a simple, easy to use, and yet powerful telegram API client for NationStates.
It was constructed due to a need for incredibly flexible and powerful API clients that simply did not exist in an
open-source context. It features advanced targeting features, and allows you to extend the functionality of the client
with your own filters.
